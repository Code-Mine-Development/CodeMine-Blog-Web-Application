## Conventions

1. Routing for modules should be implemented with respect for specification outlined in Angular 2 Guidelines https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html
Each routing configuration should be specified in separate module that is dedicated to base module of given feature set. 


2. Each component should define it's own styles

3. Services and Pipes must have tests
